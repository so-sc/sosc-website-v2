# Mangalore Bus Routes Finder

**Mangalore Bus Routes Finder** is a simple yet powerful website that provides bus routes for Mangalore local buses. Unlike major cities, Mangalore's bus network relies heavily on local knowledge, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate. This project solves that problem.

It enables users to find routes between stops, view suggestions, and even save frequently traveled paths.

The project focuses on **accessibility, community impact, and technical innovation**, making it a valuable tool for the local population.

## Key Features

- **Smart Route Finder** – Efficient algorithmic route finding to get you from A to B.
- **Comprehensive Route Database** – Extensive coverage of Mangalore's bus network.
- **Multi-Transfer Support** – Intelligently calculates routes with necessary transfers.
- **Save Journeys** – Save frequently used routes for quick access.
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Suggestions** – Instant route recommendations processed locally.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using modern web technologies to ensure performance and scalability:

- **Next.js** – App Router for efficient routing and server-side rendering
- **React** – Component-based UI architecture
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a custom design system
- **Graph Algorithms** – A custom weighted graph implementation where stops are nodes and routes are edges. It utilizes advanced traversal algorithms to calculate the shortest paths, optimize for transfers, and rank routes based on efficiency.
