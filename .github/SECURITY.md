## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it via email instead of opening a public issue.

1.  Email the vulnerability details to the project maintainers.
2.  We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
3.  We will investigate and provide a fix timeline.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.
